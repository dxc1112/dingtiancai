Dingtian Cai
------
I am currently working as a biostatistician at the Hussman Institute for Human Genomics at the University of Miami.
During my time here, I have acquired a robust skill set encompassing statistical analyses of diverse omics data, including genotyping, gene expression, DNA methylation, and next-generation sequencing data. I am well-versed in handling various genetic file types (ped, map, bed, bim, fam, gen/sample, vcf), conducting quality control for GWAS genotyping, and utilizing tools like bcftools for variant call manipulation in VCF and BCF files. Also, I am able to use the online server(TOPMed) to run imputation. Additionally, my experience extends to linkage analysis, where I am proficient in tasks such as calculating LOD scores, performing Ordered Subset Analysis (OSA), haplotyping, and processing MERLIN files. For genetic association analysis, I am skilled in using SAIGE and GENESIS for GWAS and Single Variant Association studies. And plotting GWAS Data by Manhattan plots to visually represent the results of statistical tests for association between genetic variants and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
